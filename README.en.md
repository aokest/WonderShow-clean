WonderShow (灵演) is a native macOS multi-camera presentation recording tool. It enables creators, educators, and developers to quickly record HD presentation videos with presenter picture-in-picture, supporting multi-camera switching, real-time layout adjustment, and one-click export. **Runs completely offline — no network required.**

> 💡 WonderShow started as a live presentation assistant. During development, we discovered a strong need in training and knowledge-sharing scenarios: recording the presenter's camera, screen content, and audio together — then composing them into a polished video. So v1.0 became a powerful screen recorder that produces finished videos the moment you stop recording.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎥 Multi-Camera Input
Automatically scans all available camera devices (built-in Mac camera, DJI Osmo Pocket 3, Insta360, UVC capture cards, network cameras) and selects the best one by default. Switch between cameras like a live director — no interruption needed.

### 🖥️ Live Source Switching
Pre-assign window slots (`⌘1`-`⌘6`), then switch between any active window during recording. From PPT to browser, from documents to code editor — seamless switching with zero post-production burden.

### 👤 Flexible Layouts
Switch layouts anytime (even during recording):
- Screen main + Presenter PiP
- Presenter main + Screen PiP
- Side-by-side
- Screen-only / Speaker-only

PiP supports adjustable size, position swap, crop shape (rectangle/circle/square), and free drag anywhere on screen.

### 📐 Multiple Canvas Ratios
Quickly switch between landscape, portrait, and square aspect ratios to match different platforms (Bilibili, YouTube, WeChat Channels). Switchable during recording.

### 🎙️ High-Fidelity Audio
Sample-level microphone recording (AVCaptureAudioDataOutput + AVAssetWriter), AAC encoding, independent audio track, startup transient noise filtering.

### 📦 Project-Based Workflow
One-click synthesis produces a polished final video. Simultaneously preserves three independent tracks:
- 📹 Camera raw track
- 🖥️ Screen raw track
- 🎙️ Audio raw track

All tracks are timeline-synchronized — drag directly into your favorite editor. Supports original format and **4K export**.

### 🌐 Trilingual UI
Built-in Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and English. Switch at runtime.

## 📸 Use Cases

- 🎓 Record courses, tutorials, knowledge sharing, product demos, and online lectures
- 📊 Capture narrated Keynote, PowerPoint, WPS, PDF, or browser-based presentations
- 🎬 Prepare presenter PiP content for Bilibili, YouTube, WeChat Channels
- ✅ Verify camera, microphone, screen-recording permissions before real recording
- 🔧 Build project inspectors, converters, and archiving tools using the `.wondershow` format

## 📦 Open-Source Core Package

[WonderShow Core](open-source/wondershow-core/) is an open-source Swift Package providing:

- **`.wondershow` project format**: Complete recording project schema definitions with JSON serialization
- **MediaPipe sidecar protocol**: Camera gesture recognition communication protocol
- **Plugin APIs**: Build custom project inspectors, converters, and tools

```swift
import WonderShowCore

let project = try RecordingProject.load(from: projectURL)
print(project.manifest.layout)  // Current layout
print(project.rawTracks.count)  // Number of raw tracks
```

See [open-source/wondershow-core/README.md](open-source/wondershow-core/README.md) for details.
