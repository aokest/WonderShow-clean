# 灵演 WonderShow

灵演 WonderShow is a macOS presentation and recording assistant for multiple camera inputs.

It is designed to:

- use a built-in Mac camera, DJI Osmo Pocket 3, Insta360 camera, UVC capture device, or network camera as the speaker camera;
- recognize custom gestures for slide control and annotations;
- record speaker-only or speaker-plus-screen sessions;
- support PowerPoint, WPS, Keynote, PDF viewers, and HTML slide decks.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the product architecture, feasibility notes, and staged development plan.

See [docs/HANDOFF-2026-06-18.md](docs/HANDOFF-2026-06-18.md) for the latest handoff, current feature baseline, debug history, research notes, and next iteration plan.

See [docs/recording-studio-roadmap.md](docs/recording-studio-roadmap.md) for the future recording editor, timeline zoom, picture-in-picture, and export roadmap.

## Repository Remote

- This project uses a NAS-hosted Gitea remote by default, not GitHub.
- Default remote: `nas`
- Remote URL: `ssh://gitea-nas/agent/lingyan.git`

## Current Status

This repository currently contains the tested `v0.7.20260619 (202606190305)` macOS recording-studio baseline:

- gesture intent to presentation command mapping;
- app compatibility strategy for Office, WPS, generic keyboard control, and HTML decks;
- annotation strategy selection;
- recording project planning and `.wondershow` project persistence;
- camera, selected screen/window, and selected microphone raw recording;
- monitor picture-in-picture with draggable position, size, and shape;
- source switching during recording with stable raw screen-track normalization;
- layout switching during recording through manifest timeline keyframes;
- sample-level microphone recording with continuous program audio export;
- preview composition and video export through the real renderer;
- export settings for resolution, frame rate, quality, and codec;
- multi-camera capability modeling, with Pocket 3 as one verified UVC input.

The current baseline has passed `rtk swift test --disable-sandbox` with 120 tests and `rtk bash scripts/build-app.sh` release packaging. Treat this version as the stable recording baseline before adding timeline editing, presenter video enhancement, menu-bar/mini-toolbar controls, licensing, multi-endpoint support, themes, and `Command+1` through `Command+6` fast source switching with user-defined source slots.

## Development

Run tests:

```bash
rtk swift test --disable-sandbox
```

Run the current macOS prototype from Terminal:

```bash
rtk swift run --disable-sandbox PresenterDirectorApp
```

The macOS prototype uses AVFoundation camera discovery and prefers a recognizable tracking camera such as `OsmoPocket3` when it is present, while still falling back to other available camera inputs.

## Easiest Launch For Non-Developers

Build a clickable macOS app bundle:

```bash
rtk bash scripts/build-app.sh
```

Then open the app bundle:

```bash
open "dist/灵演.app"
```

If `dist/灵演.app` already exists, you can also open it directly from Finder by double-clicking it.
